# [P-CORE] HUB_ENHANCED.md Auto-Commit Reliability Log

## Date: 2025-08-08

## 1. Problem Definition

The `HUB_ENHANCED.md` file, which serves as the central hub for task management and session logging, frequently remains uncommitted or unpushed after a session concludes. This leads to inconsistencies between the local and remote state of the project's task overview.

## 2. Observed Failure Pattern

-   After a session, `git status` often shows `docs/CORE/HUB_ENHANCED.md` as `modified` even after `invoke end` has been executed.
-   This requires manual intervention (e.g., `git add docs/CORE/HUB_ENHANCED.md`, `git commit`, `git push`) to synchronize the `HUB_ENHANCED.md` changes with the remote repository.
-   This issue has been observed multiple times, indicating a systemic problem rather than an isolated incident.

## 3. Root Cause Analysis (Hypothesis)

This problem likely stems from a combination of factors related to how `HUB_ENHANCED.md` changes are handled within the `invoke end` process and its interaction with Git.

-   **Incomplete Staging in `invoke end`:** The `invoke end` command, which is supposed to handle session cleanup and commit any remaining changes, might not be explicitly staging `HUB_ENHANCED.md` changes. While `invoke wip` is called, it might not always capture all `HUB_ENHANCED.md` modifications, especially if they occur outside the primary `wip` scope or if `HUB_ENHANCED.md` is modified by other processes.
-   **Pre-commit Hook Interference:** Although `--no-verify` was used in recent commits, there might be scenarios where `HUB_ENHANCED.md` changes trigger `pre-commit` hooks (e.g., linting, formatting checks) that cause the commit to fail silently or prevent `HUB_ENHANCED.md` from being included in the commit.
-   **Lack of Dedicated `HUB_ENHANCED.md` Commit Logic:** There isn't a specific, robust mechanism dedicated solely to ensuring `HUB_ENHANCED.md` changes are committed and pushed. Its handling is currently part of a more general `wip` commit, which might not be sufficient.

## 4. Proposed Long-Term Solutions / Future Tasks

To ensure `HUB_ENHANCED.md` is always synchronized and reflects the latest project status, a dedicated and reliable auto-commit mechanism is needed.

**Sub-tasks:**

1.  **Dedicated `HUB_ENHANCED.md` Staging and Commit:**
    *   Modify `invoke end` (or create a new internal function) to explicitly `git add docs/CORE/HUB_ENHANCED.md` before any final commit. This ensures `HUB_ENHANCED.md` changes are always staged.
    *   Consider a separate, lightweight commit specifically for `HUB_ENHANCED.md` changes if they are frequent and independent of other code changes.

2.  **Robust `HUB_ENHANCED.md` Push Strategy:**
    *   Ensure that after `HUB_ENHANCED.md` is committed, it is immediately pushed to the remote repository. This could be part of the `invoke end` process or a dedicated post-commit hook.

3.  **Pre-commit Hook Compatibility Review:**
    *   Analyze existing `pre-commit` hooks to ensure they do not inadvertently block `HUB_ENHANCED.md` commits. If necessary, add specific exceptions or configurations for `HUB_ENHANCED.md`.

4.  **Error Handling and Reporting:**
    *   Implement robust error handling for `HUB_ENHANCED.md` commit/push operations, providing clear feedback to the user if synchronization fails.

5.  **Automated Verification:**
    *   Add a CI/CD check that verifies `HUB_ENHANCED.md` is always up-to-date with the latest task statuses after a successful build or merge.

## 5. Action Taken in This Session

-   This log documents the observed issue and self-analysis.
-   This task is being created to formally track the resolution of this critical synchronization problem.
