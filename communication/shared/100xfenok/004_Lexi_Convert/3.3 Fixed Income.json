The 2-year yield reached 3.767% while the 30-year extended to 4.92%, marking the highest levels since May for long-end bonds.1114 Trading volumes remained thin ahead of a critical week featuring Fed Chair Powell's Jackson Hole speech on Friday and the July FOMC minutes release on Wednesday.1121\n\n          Key Market Drivers\n        \nTreasury weakness stems from multiple converging factors pressuring bond prices. Corporate issuance created significant supply pressure, with yields on 10-year notes rising as much as 3.5 bps due to larger-than-expected investment-grade bond supply.13 Additional IG deals are scheduled for Tuesday, with market participants rushing to issue ahead of Wednesday's $16 billion 20-year Treasury auction and potential volatility from Jackson Hole.1332Inflation concerns intensified following July's Producer Price Index, which posted a 0.9% monthly gainâ€”the fastest increase in three years.5 This data reinforced market views of the US as a \"3% inflation economy\" with potential to reach 4%, undermining aggressive rate cut expectations.6 Core services inflation excluding housing accelerated the most since January, suggesting persistent cost pressures that concern Fed officials.12The probability of a September rate cut remains elevated at approximately 80%, though market pricing has moderated from earlier dovish extremes.1226 Deutsche Bank considers a 50 bps cut \"definitely out,\" while hawkish commentary from Kansas City and Chicago Fed Presidents Schmid and Goolsbee highlighted ongoing inflation risks.12\n\n          Positioning and Technical Factors\n        \nForeign demand patterns show mixed signals across Treasury markets. While foreign holdings reached record highs in June, recent data reveals selling pressure from key regions.2225 Canada sold Treasuries in April but reversed completely in May, while Asia has bought back less than two-thirds of April's net sales.25 European investors demonstrated volatile positioning, buying in April, selling in May, then purchasing again in June.25\n\n\n\nMetric\n\nCurrent Level\n\nWeekly Change\n\nYTD Performance\n\nSource\n\n\n2-Year Yield\n\n3.767%\n\n+1.5 bps\n\n-49 bps\n\nThe Fly\n\n10-Year Yield\n\n4.334%\n\n+1.8 bps\n\n-25 bps\n\nThe Fly\n\n30-Year Yield\n\n4.92%\n\n+7 bps\n\n+14 bps\n\nSeeking Alpha\n\n2s/10s Curve\n\n56.7 bps\n\n+5 bps\n\nSteeper\n\nThe Fly\n\n271411\n\nAsset managers have increased net long positions in Treasury futures, particularly further out the curve, supporting a buy-the-dip strategy despite current weakness.2223 CFTC data shows large speculators purchased 10-year Treasuries, contributing to the recent rally before Monday's reversal.22\n\n          Jackson Hole and Policy Outlook\n        \nMarket focus centers on Fed Chair Powell's Friday speech at Jackson Hole, with traders seeking clarity on the September rate cut trajectory. Citi expects Powell to signal that employment and inflation risks are becoming more balanced, suggesting movement toward lowering rates to neutral.24 However, recent hawkish rhetoric from Fed officials and elevated inflation prints may prompt a more cautious tone.12The Fed's current 4.25%-4.5% benchmark rate range has remained unchanged throughout 2025, with Governors Waller and Bowman dissenting in July for immediate cuts.30 Treasury Secretary Bessent's advocacy for a 50 bps September cut contrasts sharply with San Francisco Fed President Daly's view that such urgency is unwarranted.30Two-year yields, highly sensitive to Fed policy, have dropped approximately 50 bps year-to-date as markets price modest easing.31 However, the front-end remains vulnerable to hawkish surprises, with analysts noting limited downside for the dollar unless Powell explicitly endorses September cuts.9 The strategic debate revolves around whether to initiate cuts early and proceed slowly, or start later with more aggressive reductions.30Wednesday's 20-year auction requires supply concessions given recent rallies and previous auction tails, potentially maintaining upward yield pressure through mid-week.13 The July FOMC minutes could provide bullish catalysts for bonds, offering insights into member stances on policy easing.13"
