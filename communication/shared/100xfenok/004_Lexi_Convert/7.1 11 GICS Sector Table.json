This regime shift historically favors Value, Small Size, Quality, and Low Risk factors while penalizing Momentum and Growth strategies.Hedge fund positioning data reveals active rotation into Technology (+1.9%), Industrials (+0.6%), and Communication Services (+0.6%) during Q2 2025, while reducing Healthcare (-1.3%), Financials (-0.7%), and Consumer Staples (-0.7%) exposure 4. Despite this tactical shift, institutional investors maintain structural underweights in Technology relative to benchmarks, a trend persisting since 2017 due to megacap concentration concerns.\n\n          Valuation Context\n        \nValue remains historically cheap relative to Growth, trading at 0.56x forward P/E, nearly two standard deviations below historic averages 2. The Growth vs Value relative forward P/E ratio sits at 1.7x, approaching ex-COVID highs. The S&P 500 Risk Premium of 515 bps as of July 31, 2025 trades slightly above the long-term average of 507 bps, suggesting modest equity attractiveness despite elevated absolute valuations.Earnings momentum continues supporting equity performance, with S&P 500 EPS growth exceeding 10% in Q2 2025, surpassing both April and January forecasts 5. However, sector dispersion remains pronounced, with seven of eleven sectors experiencing EPS downgrades since January, led by Energy (-15Pp), Materials (-10Pp), and Healthcare (-5Pp) revisions."
