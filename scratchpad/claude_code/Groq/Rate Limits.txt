Rate Limits
Rate limits act as control measures to regulate how frequently users and applications can access our API within specified timeframes. These limits help ensure service stability, fair access, and protection against misuse so that we can serve reliable and fast inference for all.

Understanding Rate Limits
Rate limits are measured in:

RPM: Requests per minute
RPD: Requests per day
TPM: Tokens per minute
TPD: Tokens per day
ASH: Audio seconds per hour
ASD: Audio seconds per day
Rate limits apply at the organization level, not individual users. You can hit any limit type depending on which threshold you reach first.

Example: Let's say your RPM = 50 and your TPM = 200K. If you were to send 50 requests with only 100 tokens within a minute, you would reach your limit even though you did not send 200K tokens within those 50 requests.

Rate Limits
The following is a high level summary and there may be exceptions to these limits. You can view the current, exact rate limits for your organization on the limits page in your account settings.

Rate Limit Headers
In addition to viewing your limits on your account's limits page, you can also view rate limit information such as remaining requests and tokens in HTTP response headers as follows:

The following headers are set (values are illustrative):

Header	Value	Notes
retry-after	2	In seconds
x-ratelimit-limit-requests	14400	Always refers to Requests Per Day (RPD)
x-ratelimit-limit-tokens	18000	Always refers to Tokens Per Minute (TPM)
x-ratelimit-remaining-requests	14370	Always refers to Requests Per Day (RPD)
x-ratelimit-remaining-tokens	17997	Always refers to Tokens Per Minute (TPM)
x-ratelimit-reset-requests	2m59.56s	Always refers to Requests Per Day (RPD)
x-ratelimit-reset-tokens	7.66s	Always refers to Tokens Per Minute (TPM)
Handling Rate Limits
When you exceed rate limits, our API returns a 429 Too Many Requests HTTP status code.

Note: retry-after is only set if you hit the rate limit and status code 429 is returned. The other headers are always included.

Need Higher Rate Limits?
If you need higher rate limits, you can request them here.
